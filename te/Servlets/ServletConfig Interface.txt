ServletConfig Interface

An object of ServletConfig is created by the web container for each servlet. 
This object can be used to get configuration information from web.xml file.

If the configuration information is modified from the web.xml file, 
we don't need to change the servlet. So it is easier to manage the 
web application if any specific content is modified from time to time.


Advantage of ServletConfig
The core advantage of ServletConfig is that you don't need to 
edit the servlet file if information is modified from the web.xml file.

HOW TO GET THE OBJECT OF SERVLETCONFIG
getServletConfig() method of Servlet interface returns the object of ServletConfig.

Syntax of getServletConfig() method
